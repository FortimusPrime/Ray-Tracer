# **Animated Ray Tracer**

_C++ Ray Tracer Algorithm that generates spinning primitives._

---

## **About the Project**

### **Overview**
- This is a C++ Ray Tracer using Linear Algebra and C++ principles. 
- The main skeleton was built using Ray Tracer From Scratch, and new additions were implemented as personal projects and personal goals.
- Algorithms to create new primitves like the cube and tetrahedron were implemented as extras.
- Animation for spinning and matrix transformations were added to spin on the axes of each object.
